# Scripts

Scripts for COMP 311 (Computer Organization) at UNC.

## install.sh

Bash script (i.e., macOS/Linux, not Windows) that downloads [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital), made by [Helmut Neemann](https://github.com/hneemann) and [MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/), made by [Kenneth Vollmar](https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/) and [Pete Sanderson](http://faculty.otterbein.edu/PSanderson/). The script also aliases commands for launching the programs.

Run with

```bash
TODO
```

Then,

* Run `digital` to launch `Digital.jar`
* Run `mars` to launch `Mars4_5.jar`
* For Digital, run `digital file.dig` to directly open `file.dig` on launch. However, this does not work for MARS.
